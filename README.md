# ColorPlay

#### Experimenting with a color picker/paint bucket tool in svg to help a friend design a quilt

## Requirements/Restrictions

* limited colors: Denyse Schmidt modern solids (75 colors)
* limited quantities of each color: 1 square = 2 triangles = 2 blocks with any given color
* three neutral colors in additional yardage: Shell, Mist, Chamois can be used more than twice
* Both blocks that use a given color should use the same neutral; if they don't, the user needs to know because block construction will differ

## Nice to have

* color swap functionality
* grey out color choices that have been used twice
* way for user to designate other colors as neutrals
* visual of which colors are neutrals/move neutrals to another part of the display
* block mover/rotation tool
* vary the number of blocks in the quilt
* dimension calculator
* swap out color set for another charm pack/fabric line
